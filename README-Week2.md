Gabriel De La Cruz:
### Must Have (We NEED these to demo)
- [ ] As an editing developer, I want to save info, so that it can be easily accessed without leaving the app open
- [ ] As an editing developer, I want to make an abstract array, so that I can control the information without being limited by an array size.
 
### Nice to Have (If we have time)
- [ ] As an editing developer, I want to make it run fast, so that info is saved in real time and doesn’t rely on leaving the API open.
- [ ] As a tester, I want it to be mostly user friendly, so that anybody can pick it up and edit their info.

Xavier Rosado:
### Must Have (We NEED these to demo)
- [ ] As a Designer, I want to have a login feature, so that users can have an account to login with.
- [ ] As a Designer, I want to code the login feature simple, so that it can be a quicker code and be more legible.
 

### Nice to Have (If we have time)
- [ ] As a Designer, I want my code to run quick, so that it doesn't have slowdown issues.
- [ ] As a Tester, I want to see all code run together, so that the main code can just be one and be something where the user can quit once done.
