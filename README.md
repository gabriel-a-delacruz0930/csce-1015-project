Group Name: Fishin’ Fans

## What's Wrong
Problem: There is no way to track fishing stats that is streamlined and easy.

## What It Does
1. Fish Registry where you can make an account, and it tracks species, color, location, weight, and time caught. Extra info can be added in comments.
2. Website that can be accessed for free, and it stores all data of a profile.
3. Rely on donations, and run ads for monetization.

### What We Planned
- [ ] Story 1: As an editing developer, I want to save info, so that it can be easily accessed without leaving the app open. (Completed)
- [ ] Story 2: As a Designer, I want to have a login feature, so that users can have an account to login with. (Completed)
- [ ] Story 3: As someone who helps others view the site, I want to be able to help the viewer/scroller get to where they want to be without issue (Completed)
- [ ] Story 4: As someone was in charge of the function for information storage, my goal was to make sure it was efficient and easy for the user to enter the information of their caught fish into the program. (Completed)
 

### What We Accomplished
- [ ] Built a working storage module
- [ ] Built a working editor for the modules
- [ ] Built a working login feature

### What We're Proud Of
1. We finished this with a lot of time to polish and iron out all the little details, without ever stressing about time.
2. We showed readiness by going to class even when we didn't have class.
3. We worked with a positive attitude and meshed extremely well, I think that this is one of the best groups I've had the pleasure of working with.
